# Godot Engine offline docs
Since the official godot-docs repo stopped updating their offline builds, I've reforked and re-enabled the workflow. 

Offline build: *will be added shortly*
[![Build documentation for offline usage](https://github.com/HippoProgrammer/godot-docs-offline/actions/workflows/build_offline_docs.yml/badge.svg?branch=4.3&event=workflow_run)](https://github.com/HippoProgrammer/godot-docs-offline/actions/workflows/build_offline_docs.yml)

Please send me a message if this repo gets out-of-date or breaks - I'll do my best to fix it!
